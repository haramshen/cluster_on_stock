# stock-cluster
The stock is clustered by machine learning method, The use of Affinity Propagation clustering algorithm to achieve. We know the most difficult to solve is to compliment the image of the problem. Using Mainfold Learning can solve the problem well. test.txt --test dateste ccluster_stock.py --run File result ---cluster result
